# Learning objectives

----

### Understand how electronic health record (**EHR**) data were leveraged<br> to study the impact of **sickle cell disease** on adverse:

- ### delivery outcomes including **stillbirth** 
- ### hematological outcomes like **blood transfusion** and **hemorrhage**<br>during delivery.

---
class: highlight-last-item

# Motivation

- ### Pregnant people are often underrepresented in clinical research,<br>as are ethnic and racial minorities

--

- ### Those pregnant with sickle cell have been shown to be at an<br>increased risk of adverse outcomes [1]

--

- ### The granularity of our dataset enables the study of pregnancy-specific contributions to the risk of a clinical complication at the time of delivery

--

- ### We estimate a higher incidence of sickle cell trait at Penn Medicine (~9.8%) compared to national estimates (~7.7%) [2]

???
The size of our dataset makes studying pregnancy outcomes among people with sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease feasible

class: highlight-last-item

# Analysis

1. ### Used our MADDIE algorithm [1] to identify **63,334 distinct deliveries**<br>from EHR of **1,060,000 female patients** with visits to<br>Penn Medicine between **2010-2017**

--

2. ### Identified **delivery and hematological outcomes of interest** <br>occurring within the patients' delivery episode(s)

--

3. ### Constructed **generalized logistic regression model** to assess<br>the risk of a variety of predictors on delivery and hematological outcomes

# Sickle cell disease

- Complex inherited genetic disorder and<br>most common hemoglobinopathy<br>in the U.S., affecting ~100,000 people [1]
- Primarily affects individuals of African ancestry and is associated with high lifetime morbidity and premature mortality [2]
- Inheriting one hemoglobin S gene results in **sickle cell trait**; inheriting two abnormal genes results in **sickle cell disease**
- The disease is characterized by abnormal hemoglobin and "sickle" red blood cells

???
The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells, or anemia.

Sickle cells are also hard and sticky and block capillaries causing myriad downstream effects including debilitating pain and other serious problems such as infection, acute chest syndrome, and stroke.

To help prevent these complications and manage their condition, people with sickle cell often require blood transfusions.

People with sickle cell trait still produce sickle cells, but perhaps not at a level that would result in detectable symptoms

Process diagram describing the steps taken in the study: 

1. Identifying patients with deliveries within the Electronic Health Record dataset using ICD codes for delivery
2. Using the MADDIE algorithm to identify distinct deliveries per patient
3. Using ICD codes to identify patients with a sickle cell diagnosis, sickle cell trait OR sickle cell disease

# Identifying delivery episodes with the MADDIE algorithm

???
Diagram depicting a patient's timeline of delivery encounters with the Penn Medicine health system. Delivery ICD codes are assigned on multiple days surrounding the true date of delivery. The MADDIE algorithm assumes that delivery encounters separated by 180 days or more can be considered to be a part of distinct delivery episodes, or distinct pregnancies.

# Limitations

--

- ### The study did not include data on hemoglobin variants which would help
  - ### Confirm sickle cell status
  - ### Identify additional patients with homozygous sickle cell disease
  - ### Identify heterozygous patients that are asymptomatic
  
--

- ### Billing codes (e.g. ICD-9/10) are imperfect at capturing clinical conditions

--

- ### Blood transfusion capture after the transition to ICD-10 was limited<br>by a change in coding practices [1]

]

???
In April of 2016 the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) issued a data alert for blood transfusions after hearing that hospitals were electing not to code blood transfusions due to the complexity of codes accompanying ICD-10. 

The alert is linked on this slide and includes coding guidance to support staff

# Conclusions

--

----

- ### Patients with sickle cell disease were not found to be at increased risk of hemorrhage, a severe maternal morbidity.

--

- ### Pregnancies of patients with sickle cell were at increased risk<br>of blood transfusions and stillbirth.

--

- ### These results underscore the need for systemic support for comprehensive coordinated care for sickle cell patients,<br>particularly during pregnancy and delivery
